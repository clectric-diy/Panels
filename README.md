# Panels-AE

Due to the CERN-OHL-S "strongly recpricol" licensing, the frontpanels on the clectric.diy modules are intentionally blank to remain compliance-safe.

That's boring. Let's get creative!

This repo is licensed as CERN-OHL-W "weakly recpricol". This means that you can use and modify any of these designs for your own modules. You're encouraged, but not required, to share your own designs with our community.

We'll do our best to police for trademark violations to protect companies, including your own, by not pulling in designs that infringe on existing works. If you have a concern about anything that you see here, please [contact us ASAP](mailto:compliance@clectric.diy).
